# Code Distribution

<br />

Varbox's license does not allow the public distribution of its source code. So, you may not build an application using Varbox and distribute that application public via open source repository hosting platforms or any other code distribution platform.

If you would like to develop a third party package that augments Varbox's functionality, you are free to do so. However, you may not distribute the Varbox source code along with your package.
