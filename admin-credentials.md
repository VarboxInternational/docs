# Admin Credentials

- [Admin URL](#admin-url)
- [Email / Password](#email-password)

<p id="first-p">
After you've successfully installed the Varbox platform you'll be able to immediately access your admin panel. 
By default the following credentials are created for that to be possible.
</p>

<a name="credentials"></a>
#### Admin URL

The admin prefix can be changed from inside the `config/varbox/admin.php` config file.

```
/admin
```

<a name="email-password"></a>
#### Email / Password

You are strongly encouraged to change these credentials to something more secure.

```
admin@mail.com / admin
```
