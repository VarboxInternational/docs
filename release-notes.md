## Versioning Scheme

<p id="first-p">
Varbox follows <a href="https://semver.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">semantic versioning</a>. 
We're trying to release major platform releases as soon as a new Laravel version is released, but that's also dependable on the [third-party packages](/docs/{{version}}/third-party-packages) the platform uses.
Minor and patch releases may be released as often as every week. Minor and patch releases should never contain breaking changes.
