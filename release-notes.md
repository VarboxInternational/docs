## Versioning Scheme

Varbox follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). 
We're trying to release major platform releases as soon as a new Laravel version is released, but that's also dependable on the [third-party packages](/docs/{{version}}/third-party-packages) the platform uses.
Minor and patch releases may be released as often as every week. Minor and patch releases should never contain breaking changes.

## Varbox 1.0

This is the first version of the Varbox platform!
