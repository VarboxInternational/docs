The menus component is a very powerful content management functionality that allows you to quickly create menu items for different page locations and assign them dynamically .

In order to provide you with a complex crud functionality inside the admin, the menus crud implements the following out of the box:

<style>
    #available-filter-operators-list > p {
        column-count: 3; -moz-column-count: 3; -webkit-column-count: 3;
        column-gap: 2em; -moz-column-gap: 2em; -webkit-column-gap: 2em;
    }

    #available-filter-operators-list a {
        display: block;
        color: #4AAEE3;
    }
</style>
<div id="available-filter-operators-list" markdown="1">

## Admin Interface

Before going deeper, you should know that there's already a section in the admin from where you can manage all your content.

You can find the menus section inside **Admin -> Manage Content -> Menus**.   
Feel free to explore all available options this section offers.

<a name="how-it-works"></a>
## How It Works

First of all, let's understand the architecture behind dynamic menus and their workflow.

<a name="the-workflow"></a>
#### The Workflow

- Select a menu location from "Admin -> Manage Content -> Menus" 
- Create a menu item from "Admin -> Manage Content -> Menus (Location)"
- Fetch your location menu items (eg. in a view composer)
- Render the proper html looping through your menu items (eg. in your view)

<a name="menu-locations"></a>
#### Menu Locations

Menu locations represent sections from your actual frontend layout where menu items can exist.   
By default, the Varbox platform exposes two menu locations: `header` and `footer`

If you want to customize this, you can do so by modifying the `config/varbox/menus.php` config file, specifically the `locations` section.

<a name="url-type-menus"></a>
#### Url Type Menus

You can specify the type of your menu item when creating or updating it.

The `url` type is the simplest type, meaning you only have to hardcode a value in the url field from the admin. It can be either internal or external.

<a name="route-type-menus"></a>
#### Route Type Menus

You can specify the type of your menu item when creating or updating it.

If you select the `route` type you'll be able to assign to your url field, a route that:
- has a name
- supports the `get` http verb
- implements the `web` middleware
- is not an `admin` route
- doesn't have any custom parameters

<a name="route-type-menus"></a>
#### Model Type Menus

You can specify the type of your menu item when creating or updating it.

Besides the `url` and `route` types, you can also assign a `urlable model` to your menu item, to fetch the url from the model record itself.

> This will only work for models that implement the `Varbox\Traits\HasUrl` trait.

To make the menus component aware of your `urlable models`, thus populating the select from the admin, you can add your classes inside the `config/varbox/menus.php`, specifically inside the `types` section.

<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage

Let's see the most common things you can do using dynamic menus.

<a name="display-menu-items"></a>
#### Display Menu Items

Let's say you want to build your header menu in your frontend. There's a number of ways to go about it, but this example will illustrate achieving that by using a `view composer` and a `blade file`

Create a `App\Http\Composers\HeaderMenuComposer` view composer:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Composers;

use Illuminate\View\View;

class HeaderMenuComposer
{
    /**
     * @param View $view
     */
    public function compose(View $view)
    {
        $menus = Menu::whereLocation('header')
            ->onlyActive()
            ->whereIsRoot()
            ->defaultOrder()
            ->get();

        $view->with([
            'menus' => $menus,
        ]);
    }
}
```

Create a `partials/menus/header.blade.php` blade file:

```php
<ul>
    @foreach($menus as $menu)
        <li>
            <a href="{{ $menu->url }}" @if($menu->data['new_window'] ?? null) target="_blank" @endif>
                {{ $menu->name }}
            </a>
            
            @if($menu->children->isNotEmpty())
                <ul>
                    @foreach($menu->children as $child)
                        <li>
                            <a href="{{ $child->url }}" @if($child->data['new_window'] ?? null) target="_blank" @endif>
                                {{ $child->name }}
                            </a>
                        </li>
                    @endforeach
                </ul>
            @endif
        </li>
    @endforeach
</ul>
```

Register the view composer in your service provider:

```php
View::composer('partials.menus.header', 'App\Http\Composers\HeaderMenuComposer');
```

<a name="create-new-menu-location"></a>
#### Create New Menu Location

To create a new menu location, go to `config/varbox/menus.php` and under the `locations` section, add your new location. 
The newly created menu location will then be available inside the admin, when creating / updating a menu.

You should create a new menu location only if you need to display menu items in a different location in your frontend.

```php
'locations' => [
    ..., 'your-location',
],
```

<a name="configuration"></a>
## Configuration

The menus configuration file is located at `config/varbox/menus.php`.

For more information on how you can customize the content management components, please read the comments from their configuration files.

<a name="overwrite-bindings"></a>
## Overwrite Bindings

In your projects, you may stumble upon the need to modify the behavior of these classes, in order to fit your needs.
Varbox makes this possible via the `config/varbox/bindings.php` configuration file. In that file, you'll find every customizable class the platform uses.

> For more information on how the class binding works, please refer to the [Custom Bindings](/docs/{{version}}/custom-bindings) documentation section.

<style>
    p.overwrite-class {
        display: block;
        font-family: SFMono-Regular,Menlo,Monaco,Consolas,Liberation Mono,Courier New,monospace;
        font-weight: 600;
        font-size: 15px;
        margin: 0;
    }
</style>
