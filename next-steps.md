# Next Steps

<br />

Now that you've successfully installed the platform and are able to sign into the admin panel, you might wonder what's next.

#### Learn The Architecture

We suggest reading the following documentation pages in order to have an idea of how the platform operates behind the scenes.

- [Vendor Files](/docs/{{version}}/vendor-files) - be aware of what files are published inside your application
- [Custom Bindings](/docs/{{version}}/custom-bindings) - learn how to extend or replace platform functionalities

#### Follow The Tutorials

We believe that's easier to learn by actually doing, instead of reading through endless documentation pages, so we offer you a few a-z tutorials to get you started using the platform.
- [Full Admin Crud](/docs/{{version}}/full-admin-crud-example) - implement a custom admin crud containing most of the functionalities available
- [Page With Blocks](/docs/{{version}}/page-with-blocks-example) - create a dynamic frontend page with assignable pieces of content
- [Translatable Model](/docs/{{version}}/translatable-model-example) - create a model with fields supporting multiple languages

#### Read The Docs

We know! Reading pages and pages of documentation can be exhausting. 
To make this a walk in the park, we've struggled to make the documentation easy to follow, so you get up & running in no time.
