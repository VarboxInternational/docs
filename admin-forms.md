#### Build Admin Forms

To build admin form elements, you can use the `form_admin()` helper function which simply acts as a wrapper over the `Collective\Html\FormBuilder` class.

> For all of the available form elements you can create, please take a look inside the `Varbox\Helpers\AdminFormHelper` class.

#### Build Multi Language Admin Forms

To build multi language admin form elements, you can use the `form_admin_lang()` helper function which simply acts as a wrapper over the `Collective\Html\FormBuilder` class.

This helper takes care of injecting your locale, thus offering you the possibility of creating or updating an element in a specific language.

> To see how the locale is automatically leveraged into your forms, please take a look inside the `Varbox\Helpers\AdminFormLangHelper` class.
